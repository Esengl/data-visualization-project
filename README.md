**Problem:**
Inequality of opportunity  (access)  in education in the Covid-19 period in Turkey.


**STEP A: Problem Description**



*Every child, without exception, should be able to benefit from the right to education, which is a constitutional right. One of the problems that the pandemic has hit hardest is education. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to education disruption affecting 1.6 billion students in more than 190 countries. The epidemic has affected students and teachers all over the world, from pre-school to higher education. Education is the most important of Turkey's bleeding wounds, with social inequality, the state of economic conditions, and the education system that has the understanding of "a model valid for everyone". Due to COVID-19, formal education was suspended in schools across the world and in our country, and distance education was started. Distance education has increased the use of technology. Internet and computer use has increased all over the world with the Covid-19 case, and the number of people who have difficulties in accessing technology is quite high, including in our country. We are already a society that has difficulties in accessing education. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we are facing a situation that is completely disconnected from education. In our country, not all students could be included in the trainings held on EBA TV and the website. Students were excluded from the educational processes due to the inadequacy or lack of necessary digital tools. With this epidemic in our country, which has difficulties in education, the gap has gradually deepened and this gap has now become a "digital gap" with the pandemic.*






**Introduction & Story**


*In this project, I wanted to do research on education, a social and political issue most affected by the pandemic. Because many students do not have personal computers or broadband internet networks. There are those who still cannot access the computer and the internet, which have become a necessity in this period. Along with this situation, pandemic conditions reduce the student's quality of education life. I would like to give the closest example to this situation. I had a friend who was my downstairs neighbor and he didn't have a personal computer. Like most people, he continued his lessons by telephone. I tried to help by sharing my computer with him during exam periods. I wanted to touch on this issue as I observed this situation closely during the pandemic period and saw it as a big problem. How many students had access to such tools or how many students had access to the internet? As I was curious about the data details on this topic, I focused on the problem of inequality and access in education.*

**STEP B: Information About Data**



**Visualization Tools**
*I searched the internet for free and easy-to-use data visualization tools. As a result of this research, I found the popular tools DataWrapper Create. So I will use this tool with combining my data.*



**Data Gathering**
*I tried to get the data from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TUIK) and reliable institutions that have done research on this subject. While I was preparing it, I had difficulties due to the lack of data on this subject or the same and similar data. Because they also compile the data of TUIK and detail their research. I have compiled the data in two separate ways: internet access data and access data to tools such as computers and tablets.*
I use TUIK's reports .Since the data is in Turkish, I translated it into English and created new tables.
